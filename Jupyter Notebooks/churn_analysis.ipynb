    "\n",
    "### What is a customer churn?\n",
    " customer churn occurs when an existing customer, user, player, subscriber or any kind of return client stops doing business or ends the relationship with a company.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of churn\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Contractual churn:\n",
    " Contractual churn occurs when a customer is under contract for a service and decides to cancel their service. <br>Example: Cable TV, SaaS products (Software as a Service e.g. Dropbox).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Voluntary churn:\n",
    " Voluntary churn occurs when a user voluntarily cancels a service and includes prepaid cell phones, streaming subscriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-contractual churn:\n",
    " Non-contractual churn ocurs when a customer is not under contract for a service and includes customer loyality at a retail location or online browsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Involuntary churn:\n",
    " Involuntary churn occurs when a churn occurs not at the request of the customer. For example: credit card expiration, utilities being shut off by the provider. <br>Most likely, you as a customer have cancelled a service for a variety of reasons including lack of usage, poor service or better price."
